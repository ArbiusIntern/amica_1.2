## Amica Life Features

Amica Life is designed to operate in a semi-autonomous mode, incorporating animations, sleep functionality, function calling, a subconscious subroutine, and self-prompting features to create a seamless virtual assistant experience.

### Key Features of Amica Life

* **Subconscious Subroutine**: Amica stores compressed conversation logs with timestamps, enabling it to remember past interactions and influence future responses. This enhances conversation continuity and provides a more personalized experience over time.

* **Random Animation Playback**: Amica supports customizable VRM (Virtual Reality Model) avatars. These avatars can randomly trigger animations, dynamically express emotions, sync with speech, and react in real-time, providing an immersive interface.

* **News Function Calling**: Amica can autonomously retrieve real-time news and relevant information based on contextual triggers within conversations. This feature ensures users stay informed without the need for manual searches.

* **Self-Prompting System**: Amica’s self-prompting system can independently generate follow-up questions or perform actions based on ongoing discussions. This makes conversations more interactive and allows the assistant to anticipate user needs.

## Load/Save VRM Feature

Amica supports loading and saving customizable VRM avatars, allowing users to personalize their virtual assistant. Avatars can be loaded or saved for future use, with dynamic expression of emotions and lip-syncing in real-time.

## Load/Save Conversation Feature

Users can load and save chat conversations as `.txt` files. This feature is ideal for storing conversation histories, reviewing past discussions, or continuing from where a previous session left off.

## Wake Word Feature

Amica includes a wake word detection feature, allowing users to activate the assistant with a specific phrase. This enables hands-free operation and provides a more natural interaction with the system.

## Chat Mode Feature

In Chat Mode, Amica’s avatar minimizes into a corner of the screen, providing a compact interface. This feature is useful for multitasking, allowing users to interact with Amica while focusing on other tasks.

## Plugin System (Function Calling) Feature

Amica Life supports a customizable plugin system that allows users to add their own function calls. By placing scripts in the designated plugin folder, new functionalities can be seamlessly integrated, expanding Amica's capabilities.
